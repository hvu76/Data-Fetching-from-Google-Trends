#Data-Fetching-from-Google-Trends

Data Scraping and Analysis Project

For this project, I would like to collect and analyze data from Google Trends on the trends of a certain list of keywords that were searched on Google in 2019 and 2020 in Vietnam. This project has different stages to it that formulate a complete code program:

I created an excel file that contains the keywords that I wanted get data on. There are a total of 65 keywords divided into 7 topics.

Using the pytrends package, I found the data on the number of searches of these keywords on Google Trends in 2019 and 2020 and assign them to a new excel file.

I also put the data I gathered into the Postgresql database system for accessible and convenient data management.

I performed some analysis on the top 5 and top 10 keywords that were searched the most in 2019 and 2020. I also found the most searched keyword in each month of 2019 and 2020 and executed visualization on this.

The final result of this project is to create a program that asks for a user's input of an excel file that contains certain keywords that they want to collect data on on Google Trends, save the data into a Postgresql database, and perform data visualization of the analysis of that data.
